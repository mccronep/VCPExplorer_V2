  The VCPExplorer is a tool to aid in visualizing radar beam paths with respect
 to the terrain surrounding the radar. &nbsp;The VCPExplorer consists of
4  main parts: the Info Bar, the PPI Panel, the RHI Panel and the VCP Controls<br>

  <br>
  <br>
  <u>Choose Radar</u>:<br>
   
<blockquote>Under the <i>File</i> selection of the menubar, choose the desired
 radar<br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <u>Rotate Radial</u>:<br>
   
<blockquote>Once the VCPExplorer finishes loading (and this may take several
 seconds to a few minutes, depending on the speed of your computer), place
 your mouse on the end (away from center) of the <font color="#ff0000">RED
   <font color="#000000">radial in the PPI Panel. &nbsp;Left-click on the
  </font></font><font color="#ff0000">RED</font> dot and drag the dot around
 the PPI. &nbsp;Notice the terrain (jagged line) in the RHI Panel change.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>
  <u>Change Radar Beam Elevation Angles</u>:  
<blockquote>In the VCP Controls, either select the desired elevation angle
 or click on the  <img src="../Img/up.gif" alt="" width="24" height="24">
   (up) and <img src="../Img/down.gif" alt="" width="24" height="24">
   (down) arrows to change the radar beam elevation angle. &nbsp;Notice the
 beam (curved line) in the RHI Panel change. &nbsp;Also, you can enter an
elevation angle (even angles less than zero) in the "Enter Elev. Angle" box.
&nbsp;The beam will not update until you <u><b>press enter</b></u>.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <u>View Beam Blockage</u>:<br>
   
<blockquote>Enter a value in the "Beam Blockage (Whole %)" box and <u><b>press
 enter</b></u>. &nbsp;Then click on the "GC" button in the RHI Panel. &nbsp;After
 a few seconds, you should see a grey transparent pattern on the PPI Panel.
 &nbsp;These are areas where the radar beam is blocked greater than or equal
 to the percent that you enterd in the box.<br>

<h3>Config Files</h3>
   
<div align="left"><br>
  </div>
  <br>
  The Config Files can be found in the "ConfigFiles" directory of your installation.
 &nbsp;The files currently included are:<br>
   
<blockquote><b>88D_siteList.dat</b>: &nbsp;<br>
       
  <blockquote>The list of WSR-88D radar sites and respective information.
 &nbsp;This is a TAB-DELIMETED file and should be backed up if any changes
 are made to it. &nbsp;Since radar locations are rarely changed, this file
 should be rarely altered.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <b>TDWR_siteList.dat</b>:<br>
       
  <blockquote>Like the <b>88D_siteList.dat</b> file but for TDWR sites<br>
    </blockquote>
    <b>vcpList.dat</b>:<br>
       
  <blockquote>This file contains two TAB-DELIMETED columns: the VCP identifier
 (e.g., VCP11) and a COMMA-DELIMETED list of elevation angles. &nbsp;The
VCPExplorer  uses these entries directly to label the respective parameters
in the VCP  Controls area.<br>

<h3>FAQ<br>
  </h3>
   
<div align="left"><br>
  </div>
  <br>
  <br>
  This is a working list of questions about the VCP Explorer. &nbsp;Feel
free  to submit more questions to &lt;<i>kevin.manross@noaa.gov</i>&gt; and
further updates of this program will try to include them.<br>
  <br>
  <br>
Whoa, the terrain image in the PPI Display is blown up and unresponsive,
what do I do?<br>
<br>
<blockquote>Haven't been able to track down this bug yet, sorry. &nbsp;Best
thing to do is to reselect the radar.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<br>
OK, everything appears to have loaded, but there's no terrain in the PPI
Display<br>
<blockquote>The image should appear if you middle click in the PPI Display.
&nbsp;If that doesn't work, try reselecting the radar.<br>
</blockquote>
<br>
<br>
<br>
  <br>
  Why does the VCPExplorer take so long to load?  
<blockquote>Currently the biggest reason is that the VCPExplorer must go
through the entire terrain file (usually around&nbsp; 800,000 grid points)
and calculate an elevation angle for each point. &nbsp;This allows for faster
rendering of Beam Blockage. &nbsp;It is planned to cache the elevation angle
points for each radar site in the terrain netCDF files to load faster.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
<br>
  Why does dragging take so long after I use the <b>GC</b> button?<br>
  <br>
   
<blockquote>Most likely this is due to graphics card issues. &nbsp;If your
 graphics card <u><b>does not</b></u>: <br>
       
  <blockquote>support OpenGL, <br>
  have OpenGL and 3D rendering drivers installed<br>
    </blockquote>
  then this will dramatically slow down the responsiveness of te program.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <br>
<br>
  I only have 2 mouse buttons, how do I get the AZ/Ran/Elevation display?<br>
   
<blockquote>I'm working on that<br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <br>
<br>
  <br>
  Why is the beam height displayed "Above Sea Level "?<br>
   
<blockquote>I just though of this while writing the help menu and am looking
 into it.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
  <br>
<br>
  What's with VCP12? &nbsp;When I turn on all the beams and beam widths and
 beam fills, the lowest elevations are hard to figure out.<br>
   
<blockquote>This is partially a matter of trying to find a good way to depict
 the overlapping that occurs with VCP12 and other VCPs that have much overlapping.
 &nbsp;It is also an issue with the current build of Java2/3 and VisAD that
 this program was written in. &nbsp;Once we work some bugs out, I have another
 color/overlapping scheme in mind.<br>
    <br>
  </blockquote>
  <br>
<br>
<br>
  Speaking of programming languages, what is this program written in and
what  about license issues?<br>
   
<blockquote>The VCPExplorer is written in Java&reg; for platform independence
 and uses a Java package known as VisAD. &nbsp;VisAD is developed by the
same  folks that made Vis5D.<br>
    <br>
  This program is distributed with the Sun Java2&reg; (1.4.2) JRE as well 
as the Sun Java3D&reg; (Windows&reg;) or Blackdown Java3D&reg; (Linux) JRE.
 &nbsp;Under Sun Licensing, the JRE's are freely distributable. &nbsp;VisAD
 is covered under GPLA.<br>
